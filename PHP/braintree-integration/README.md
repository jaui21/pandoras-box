This PHP script allows you to accept one time payments as well as recurring payments (subscriptions) directly on your website. Credit cards are processed using your Braintree account and customers can complete that process without leaving your site. PayPal Standard is also available, in which case your customers will be sent to PayPal to complete payment. There is also a secure admin page where you can view and manage all of your payments, subscriptions, items, invoices, settings, etc.
